  %h2 Expectations for Students
  %p
    Before applying, students should read and agree to follow the
    %a{href: "http://www.shaolin.org/general/laws.html"} 10 Shaolin Laws.
    However, there are some concepts worth expanding upon.

  %ul
    %li We're not just a kung fu class, we're a traditional kung fu family. We genuinely care about each other and help each other improve. Please act accordingly.

    %li If you're going to be late or you can't make class one night, please let the instructor know as a courtesy.

    %li Establishing a personal practice is crucial for students to get the full benefits of practicing Shaolin Kung Fu. That means practicing at home for 30 minutes to an hour every day. (It's ok to miss a day occasionally.) If that sounds like a big commitment, don't worry, the Shaolin Kung Fu Foundations Course is designed to help you get there. Once you establish a daily practice, you will be amazed at how powerfully it affects your life!
