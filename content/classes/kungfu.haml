  %p The Shaolin Kung Fu Foundations Course is a 17-week class covering the entire Shaolin Kung Fu Level 1 curriculum. It is "foundational" because everything else in Shaolin Kung Fu is built on top of the material covered in this course, making it the most important and most useful.

  %h3 Course Objectives
  %p Students who attend class and practice consistently can expect to achieve the following objectives by the completion of the course:

  %ul
    %li develop the skill to generate a chi flow
    %li know the basic kung fu stances and use them to develop internal force
    %li move around using kung fu stances and basic kung fu footwork
    %li perform One Finger Shooting Zen, one of the treasures of our school, to build internal force and enhance mental clarity
    %li know the 8 basic hand patterns and how to use them to attack and defend high, middle, low, and sideways
    %li have a basic understanding of Chi Kung and Shaolin Kung Fu philosophy
    %li have direct experience of the benefits of practicing genuine Shaolin Kung Fu, including personal growth, a clearer, more powerful mind, improved health and happiness, more energy for daily life, improved combat efficiency, and spiritual joys (which benefit students of any religious or non-religious beliefs)
    %li be ready for Shaolin Kung Fu Level 2

  %h3 Course Details
  %p The course will start on February 15, 2016 and run until the end of June (June 27, 2016). This is actually longer than 17 weeks, and we can use this bonus time to solidify the skills developed during the course itself or possibly move into some extra material if the students are ready for it. The class will meet every Monday night from 7pm - 9pm. Students will be given clear guidance on what to practice between classes.

  %p The Shaolin Kung Fu Foundations course is only for adults. However, mature teenagers will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

    Before applying, students should read and agree to follow the

    However, there are some concepts worth expanding upon.

  %ul
    %li We're not just a kung fu class, we're a traditional kung fu family. We genuinely care about each other and help each other improve. Please act accordingly.

    %li If you're going to be late or you can't make class one night, please let the instructor know as a courtesy.

    %li Establishing a personal practice is crucial for students to get the full benefits of practicing Shaolin Kung Fu. That means practicing at home for 30 minutes to an hour every day. (It's ok to miss a day occasionally.) If that sounds like a big commitment, don't worry, the Shaolin Kung Fu Foundations Course is designed to help you get there. Once you establish a daily practice, you will be amazed at how powerfully it affects your life!
