  %h2 Weekly Adult Shaolin Kung Fu Class

  %p Shaolin Kung Fu class is every Monday night from 7-9pm at the Unitarian Universalist Church of  St. Petersburg (719 Arlington Ave N on Mirror Lake). The fees are as follows:

  %ul
    %li $150/month for a year (this is a special rate. The regular rate is $300/month)
    %li $1200 for a year if you pay upfront (which comes out to $100/month. The regular rate is $3000)

  %p Please note that there are no contracts. If you decide that Shaolin Kung Fu is not for you, simply let me know and stop paying. If you paid upfront, I will refund you a prorated amount.

  %p The rates are "for a year" because a year is 1) not very long, and 2) a good amount of time to give a deep art like Shaolin Kung Fu a reasonable try. It's also a natural milestone for us to reflect on your progress and your goals. But it won't take a year for you to experience the tremendous benefits of your Shaolin Kung Fu practice. The benefits will start in the first class, and if you don't directly experience them then, you will shortly thereafter.

  %h3 Expectations For Students

  %p
    In short, students should agree to follow the
    %a{href: "http://www.shaolin.org/general/laws.html"} 10 Shaolin Laws.
    However, there are some concepts in there worth expanding upon.

  %ul
    %li We're not just a kung fu class, we're a kung fu family. We genuinely care about each other and help each other improve. Please act accordingly.

    %li If you're going to be late or you can't make class one night, please let me know as a courtesy.

    %li Establishing a personal practice is crucial for students to get the full benefits of practicing Shaolin Kung Fu. That means practicing at home for 30 minutes to an hour every day. (It's ok to miss a day occasionally.) If that sounds like a big commitment, don't worry, I'll help you get there, and you'll soon be looking forward to your next practice session. Once you establish a daily practice, you will be amazed at how powerfully it affects your life!

    %li Please pay your class fees on time. The less time I have to spend tracking and chasing down payments, the more time I can spend innovating my teaching!
