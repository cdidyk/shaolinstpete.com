title: "My Path to Shaolin"
---

I was 24 when I started looking for a way to be active again. I had graduated from college and spent the subsequent years focused on starting my life as a Responsible Working Adult as best I could. I knew I needed to take care of myself physically, too, though, and I was struggling to find a way that was both enjoyable and could hold my attention. The sports I grew up playing no longer held the same appeal, but martial arts seemed interesting. I enjoyed practicing Taekwondo as a teenager, but there was another martial art that had always fascinated me. And so I decided that if I was going to take up a martial art, it would have to be Shaolin Kung Fu.

But where would I find a Shaolin Kung Fu school? I turned to my good friend, the internet. I was surprised to find that most kung fu schools didn't seem to use kung fu in their sparring. Maybe they incorporated kung fu principles, but the sparring itself looked similar to how we sparred at my Taekwondo school. The only place I could see what I could identify as kung fu was in the beautiful traditional kung fu sets they practiced. I found this confusing. One of the main reasons I wanted to learn kung fu was so I could fight using the exotic moves I grew up watching in kung fu movies. If I couldn't do that, what was the point of practicing kung fu?

I was discouraged, but not enough to stop looking. Soon afterward, I stumbled across my Sigung's [site](http://www.shaolin.org) and an [article](http://flowingzen.com/366/shaolin-sparring/) my Sifu wrote about Shaolin Wahnam's sparring methodology. The more I read, the more excited I got. This methodology made sense to me! Even though I had never practiced kung fu, my previous Taekwondo training helped me see that following this methodology would get me to where I could fight using traditional kung fu! I didn't know anything about the advantages built into traditional kung fu patterns and stances, and I didn't know whether chi and internal force were real, but I knew I had to try this art and judge it from direct experience.

The only problem was that the nearest teacher was over 500 miles away! For some reason, I didn't let that stop me. I contacted him anyway, and he told me that Shaolin Kung Fu could be practiced well with only periodic lessons if I practiced regularly on my own. In fact, he had to travel *halfway around the world* to visit his Sifu for lessons! I made arrangements with him for my first lesson and passed the time digging through the wealth of material on shaolin.org and reading *The Complete Book of Shaolin*. I felt like a kid on Christmas Eve, so excited for the goodies awaiting me on Christmas Day that I couldn't sleep!

It's a good thing I was so excited because the distance meant that I had to get up at 6 am on a Saturday and drive 8 hours to have my lesson! As you might imagine, my expectations had built up quite high, but they were still shattered during my first lesson. From the moment I met him, it was clear that my Sifu was an excellent martial artist and knew what he was talking about. I still remember being in awe when I watched him demonstrate moving around in stances. He made it look so fluid and effortless! In contrast, it felt so awkward and unnatural to me. But with his instruction, I knew that the difference between awkward and fluid was simply a matter of practice. Years later, when new students would wonder how they could ever move in stances like me, my Sifu liked to tell them about how much clumsier my footwork was at my first lesson than theirs was!

Perhaps the most eye-opening experience was feeling chi and internal force. They felt both cool and perfectly natural. I had read about chi flow, so I wasn't weirded out by it. I was able to trust my Sifu and follow his instructions well enough to receive the transmission of internal skills he was giving me. And I saw for myself that traditional kung fu patterns could be used for fighting and that the spirituality made famous by the Shaolin monks was built into Shaolin Kung Fu itself. This art was everything I was looking for and then some! I was hooked.

After those first lessons, every month or two I would spend a weekend doing the same thing: getting up early Saturday morning, driving 8 hours from New Orleans to Gainesville, Florida, having a two hour lesson Saturday evening, having another two hour lesson Sunday morning, and then getting back home to New Orleans in the evening. And I practiced about an hour a day as best I could in between trips to see my Sifu.

After Hurricane Katrina, I moved to Austin, TX, but I still traveled to Florida regularly for lessons. Instead of driving every month or two, I flew every 3-4 months. Upon hearing my story, some people seemed to marvel at my dedication (others thought I was crazy, but I digress!), but it never felt like that big of a deal to me. Sure, it was more than many people would be willing to do, but it was also less than people like my Sifu did. The results I was getting (and continue to get) from my practice far exceeded whatever sacrifices I made to visit my Sifu for lessons. Plus, this was my last attempt at finding the martial art of my dreams. If I hadn't found it, I would not be practicing *any* martial art today!

Eventually, I got smart enough to just move to Florida. Not only did I get to learn from my Sifu more regularly, but I met my wife through kung fu class! It turns out that she was driving 2.5 hours to Gainesville for class every week from her home town: St. Petersburg. I soon discovered for myself what an amazing and beautiful city St. Petersburg is, and we have been happily building our life together here ever since.

I can't be sure what the future holds for me, but I am sure that I will practice and spread the Shaolin Arts for the rest of my life, and that practicing these arts will continue to mold me into the best and happiest version of myself that I can be. What more could I ask for?
