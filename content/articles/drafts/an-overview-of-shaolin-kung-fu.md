title: "An Overview of Shaolin Kung Fu"

Shaolin Kung Fu is such a vast art that if you ask ten different practitioners at ten different schools what it is, you could very well get ten different answers!

To help my new students form a better understanding and foundation for their practice, I've categorized the Shaolin Kung Fu I teach and practice into four major components. If you take my intro class, you will experience a bit of each first-hand.

## Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung ##
If Shaolin Kung Fu was a car, Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung would be the engine. It's how we cultivate chi or energy (also spelled "qi"). Chi has gotten a bad rap in some circles due to teachers who treat it as some sort of mysterious, magical force. But not only is chi natural, it's easy to cultivate if you know how.

In addition to powering our kung fu, cultivating chi with Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung has some terrific benefits in its own right: radiant health, more energy for daily life, a clearer, more powerful mind, and a stronger spirit leading to ever-greater senses of peace and happiness. Students begin to notice at least some of these benefits soon after they begin practicing Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung, and by "soon", I mean usually in the first class and certainly within a month.

## Stance Training ##
Stance Training is our primary method for developing internal force. When an internal martial artist strikes, the real power of the strike comes from internal force, not muscular strength. While lifting weights builds localized muscle, internal force is much more widely applicable. The same internal force gained from properly sitting in the horse stance can be used to power a punch or kick, keep you feeling energized throughout the day, give you the courage to do the right thing in a difficult situation, or give you the strength to make the sort of change in your life that you know you want but have found too hard to do in the past.

Internal force is also the great equalizer when it comes to age, size, and gender. It's why I can't move Grandmaster Wong even though I'm almost 40 years younger and much bigger than him, and why my 5-foot tall wife can overwhelm students much bigger and physically stronger than her.

## Footwork and Body Movement ##
It's not enough to sit blissfully in a stance and not move. To be able to use stances advantageously in combat, you have to be able to move fluidly and efficiently and change course instantly. Your entire body must work together in concert, not be disjointed. Practicing proper footwork and body movement gives you those benefits, and it also gives you practical strength and flexibility while helping to improve the circulation of chi smoothly throughout your body, especially to your knees and legs. If you consider yourself to be clumsy or uncoordinated, practicing good footwork and body movement will make you graceful. If you're already graceful, you'll become even more graceful, faster, and efficient in your movement. In daily life, these skills allow you to avoid stepping your bare foot down onto the LEGO bricks your kid left out -or out into traffic in front of the car you didn't see.

## Combat Application ##
Traditional Shaolin Kung Fu patterns were developed by past masters over more than a thousand years, mostly during times when their lives depended on their fighting abilities. Thankfully, we no longer live in such times, but we can still benefit tremendously from learning to fight using traditional kung fu patterns. While using traditional patterns feels awkward and unnatural at first, with some practice, their incredible advantages come to life. The process is not only safe, effective, and systematic, but a lot of fun.

Because Shaolin Kung Fu is meant for life-and-death combat with no rules or safety equipment, traditional patterns cover just about any sort of attack and defense you can think of. Because it's Shaolin Kung Fu, practicing combat application leads you to become a happier, more confident, and more compassionate person.
