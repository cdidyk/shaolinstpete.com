title: "An Overview of Shaolin Kung Fu"
---

To help my new students form a better understanding and foundation for their practice, I've categorized the Shaolin Kung Fu I teach and practice into four major components. If you take my intro class, you will experience a bit of each first-hand.

## Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung ##
"If you want to soar to the heights and reach the depths of Kung Fu, you must practice Chi Kung; if you want to soar to the heights and reach the depths of Chi Kung, you must practice meditation." - Sitaigung Ho Fatt Nam

Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung is at the heart of internal Shaolin Kung Fu. By practicing it, students learn how to deepen their abilities to relax, enter a powerful meditative state of mind, and circulate chi through their bodies. Over time, it results in a powerful, clear mind, radiant health, and deep happiness, but students typically begin noticing benefits during the first class!

If Shaolin Kung Fu was a car, Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung would be the engine. It's how we cultivate chi or energy. Chi has gotten a bad rap in some circles due to teachers who treat it as some sort of mysterious, magical force. But not only is chi natural, it's easy to cultivate if you know how.

In addition to powering our kung fu, cultivating chi with Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung has some terrific benefits in its own right: radiant health, more energy for daily life, a clearer, more powerful mind, and a stronger spirit leading to ever-greater senses of peace and happiness. Students begin to notice at least some of these benefits soon after they begin practicing Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung, and by "soon", I mean usually in the first class and certainly within a month.

## Stance Training ##
Stance Training is our primary method for developing internal force, which is a condensed form of chi. While Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung helps you develop the ability to circulate chi, stance training helps you develop the ability to build more chi. When an internal martial artist strikes, the real power of the strike comes from internal force, not muscular strength, and while lifting weights builds localized muscle, internal force is much more widely applicable. The same internal force gained from properly sitting in the horse stance can be used to power a punch or kick, keep you feeling energized throughout the day, or give you the strength to make an important life change.

Internal force is also the great equalizer when it comes to age, size, and gender. It's why I can't move Grandmaster Wong even though I'm almost 40 years younger and much bigger than him, and why my 5-foot tall wife can overwhelm students much bigger and physically stronger than her.

## Footwork and Body Movement ##
It's not enough to sit blissfully in a stance and not move. To be able to use stances advantageously in combat, you have to be able to move fluidly and efficiently and change course instantly. Your entire body must work together in concert, not be disjointed. Practicing proper footwork and body movement gives you those benefits, while also giving you practical strength and flexibility and improving the circulation of chi smoothly throughout your body (especially to your knees and legs). If you consider yourself to be clumsy or uncoordinated, practicing good footwork and body movement will make you graceful. If you're already graceful, you'll become even more agile.

## Combat Application ##
Traditional Shaolin Kung Fu is a complete martial art. Its patterns were developed by past masters over more than a thousand years to launch and counter nearly any conceivable attack, mostly during times when their lives depended on their fighting abilities. Thankfully, we no longer live in such times, but we can still benefit tremendously from learning to fight using traditional kung fu patterns. After all, the same skills developed in sparring are applicable when negotiating an important business deal, giving a performance, taking a big test, and much more.

Our [basic curriculum](/curriculum) is Southern Shaolin Kung Fu, but there are many fascinating styles and sets within that categorization, such as Tiger-Crane, Dragon-Tiger, Five Animal, Dragon, and Monkey. Our Shaolin Wahnam school also has a few styles and sets that originated outside of Southern Shaolin Kung Fu, like Wuzuquan, Wudang Taijiquan, and Baguazhang.

Because Shaolin Kung Fu is meant for life-and-death combat with no rules or safety equipment, traditional patterns cover just about any sort of attack and defense you can think of. Because it's Shaolin Kung Fu, practicing combat application leads you to become a happier, more confident, and more compassionate person.
