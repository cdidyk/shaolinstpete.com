title: "Shaolin Kung Fu Curriculum"
---

Our Shaolin Kung Fu curriculum is organized into 12 levels designed for systematic progress. The first two levels consist of all of the fundamentals of Shaolin Kung Fu: how to generate an energy flow throughout your body, build internal force, use stances and footwork to move with agility and grace, and apply basic hand attacks and defenses. Students also learn One Finger Shooting Zen, one of the treasures of our school, at the first level.

Once students are proficient in the fundamentals, they practice the 16 basic combat sequences. These two-man sequences cover all four categories of attack: hand strikes, kicks, felling/grappling, and chin-na (gripping). Through our sparring methodology, students systematically learn how to apply and adapt the sequences in free sparring.

After the 16 basic combat sequences, students train classical kung fu sets. First, Cross Roads at Four Gates, which was once the fundamental set practiced by all martial monks at the southern Shaolin Temple, then, the Ho Family Flowing Water Staff and Plum Flower Sabre. As part of their weapons training, students learn the characteristics and some signature patterns of each of the major weapons. (After completing the 12 levels, students may choose to focus more deeply on a weapon.) It's worth noting that when we train sets, we also train their signature skills, force-training methods, and how to apply their patterns in combat.

In the last levels, students learn how to disarm an armed attacker and fight multiple attackers, both armed and unarmed. It is often difficult to grasp the depth of Shaolin Kung Fu, but maybe the fact that these 12 levels only represent the basics gives you some idea! After completing the curriculum, there is still much to learn, and students can choose from a number of sets and skills for specialized training.

While the material in the curriculum is focused on the combat aspects of Shaolin Kung Fu, a point of emphasis in Shaolin Wahnam is that practicing Shaolin Kung Fu should enrich our daily lives. Students become healthy, relaxed, happy, and full of energy. Their minds become clear and sharp and their performance improves in everything they do. In short, they realize the best versions of themselves. These benefits are a direct result of practicing high-level Shaolin Kung Fu and are enhanced as students progress.

Please note that advancement is earned on merit, and the timeframes for each level are based on a typical student. It takes such a student 4-5 years to complete all 12 levels.
