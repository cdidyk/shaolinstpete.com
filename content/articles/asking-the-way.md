# Asking the Way #
When a Shaolin Kung Fu exponent fights, her first priority is avoiding taking any injuries. Asking the Way is crucial to achieving that aim. It's a bit like dipping your toe in the water of a pool to check its temperature before jumping in. Instead of launching an attack and hoping you hit your partner before she hits you, you test your partner out first. If you can create a favorable opening and exploit it safely, you do so. If not, you abandon gracefully or adapt your attack.

## Working Definitions ##
Asking the Way
: testing your partner before committing to an attack. Asking the Way usually includes bridging and taming.

Bridging
: keeping contact with your partner so that you can feel her movements. Usually, bridging is done with the forearm or hand, to your partner's forearm.

Taming
: controlling  your partner's body (usually her arm) both to allow you to attack safely and to increase the chance of attacking successfully

Opening
: taming by moving your partner's arm away from her body

Closing
: taming by moving your partner's arm into her body

Same Side
: taming the arm of your partner that is on the same side as the arm you are taming with. For example, taming your partner's right hand with your left hand. The main point of "same side" is that you don't have to reach across your body to tame.

Opposite Side
: taming the arm of your partner that is on the opposite side as the arm you are taming with. For example, taming your partner's right hand with your right hand. The main point of "opposite side" is that you have to reach across your body to tame.

## Some Possibilities in Asking the Way ##
When practicing with a live partner or especially on your own with an imaginary one, it's helpful to categorize asking the way into four main categories. There are variations such as also floating your partner's arm up or pulling it down, but these variations still fall under the main categories.

### Same Side Opening ###
Opening your partner's right arm with your left or left arm with your right. When you do this, you expose targets on your partner's torso and head, but you have to watch out for her other hand beating you to the punch as you attack. If you're aware of this as you Same Side Open, you should be able to adjust your other hand to defend her attempted counter into either Same Side Closing (with your second hand) or Opening Both Sides before continuing in.

### Same Side Closing ###
Closing your partner's right arm with your left or left arm with your right. When you do this, you expose fewer targets on your partner's torso and head, but you are much safer in your attack, as you can frequently use Same Side Closing to tame both of your partner's arms with only one of yours. You can feel when you have your partner well-tamed this way, but if she can create some separation between her tamed arm and her body, she can create enough space to strike with her other hand. As long as you can sense when this happens, you can adjust what you're doing as needed.

### Opposite Side Opening ###
Opening your partner's right arm with your right arm or her left with your left. This is rarely used as its disadvantages usually outweigh its advantages. Usually when you Opposite Side Open, you do it to transition to Same Side Opening. For instance, when you Opposite Side Open your partner's right arm with your left, you then immediately thread with your right to Same Side Open your partner's right with your right, freeing  your left to attack. You might do this as part of entering to attack from a distance.

### Opposite Side Closing ###
Closing your partner's right arm with your right or her left with your left. This is a really strong position as you gain the benefits of Same Side Closing while generally being even safer from a counter attack.

### Opening Both Sides ###
Opening both of your partner's arms as the same time. This is a strong position since your arms are usually inside of your partner's leading to strong opportunities to kick your partner or follow either bridge (or both). Of course, she can potentially kick you, too! If you follow either bridge, you need to do so skillfully, as your partner can potentially leak around your arms to strike you (especially if she has a longer reach than you). With some footwork, you can easily transition from Opening Both Sides to a strong Same Side Open to either side.

### Closing Both Sides ###
Closing both of your partner's arms at the same time. This is also a strong position for pushing, kicking, and potentially taming two with one to free up a hand to strike. Since your partner's arms are pinned in against her body, her options are more limited than with Opening Both Sides.
